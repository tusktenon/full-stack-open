# The Anecdotes Application

This [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vite.dev/) app was built up as the solution to exercises [1.12 to 1.14](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/a_more_complex_state_debugging_react_apps#exercises-1-6-1-14) of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) MOOC from the University of Helsinki.


## Running the application

Simply enter `npm run dev` from the project's root directory. Vite will start the application at `http://localhost:5173/` (or the next free port number if 5173 is unavailable).
