# The Course Information Application (Part 2)

This [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vite.dev/) app was built up as the solution to exercises [2.1 to 2.5](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/rendering_a_collection_modules#exercises-2-1-2-5) of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) MOOC from the University of Helsinki. It's the continuation of the `courseinfo` app from Part 1.


## Running the application

Simply enter `npm run dev` from the project's root directory. Vite will start the application at `http://localhost:5173/` (or the next free port number if 5173 is unavailable).
