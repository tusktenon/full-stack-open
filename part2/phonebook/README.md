# The Phonebook Application

This [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vite.dev/) app was built up as the solution to exercises [2.6 to 2.10](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/forms#exercises-2-6-2-10), [2.11](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/getting_data_from_server#exercise-2-11), and [2.12 to 2.15](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/altering_data_in_server#exercises-2-12-2-15) of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) MOOC from the University of Helsinki.


## Running the application

The app fetches the initial phonebook data (in `db.json`) from a running instance of [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Start the server with `npm run server` (it's been configured to run on port 3001). You can then start the app itself with the usual `npm run dev`.
